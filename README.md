# SunRiseLamp
The goal of this project is to create a Sun Rise lamp so you can wake up more naturally.

#I would like to thank.
 BulldogLowell over at community.particle.io 

## Getting started 

First go to the particle web IDE. Create a new project and call it `SunRise`.

After that, open SunRiseLamp.ino in a text editor and copy and paste the code into your new project in the web IDE.   NOTE: If there is a better way to implement this please notify me.

Now create new files in the Web IDE and add name them `SunRiseLamp.h` and `SunRiseLamp.cpp`

Copy the code from their corresponding files in your text editor and paste it into the new files you created in the web IDE.


Now go to the Library tab. Search for the neopixel library and add it to the new project.

 If you have a WS2812b/neopixel strip connected to you photon you can flash the code
 
 if you want to change the parameters it's super simple. just change the value of does.
 
`#define PIXEL_PIN D0`
`#define PIXEL_COUNT 14`
`#define PIXEL_TYPE WS2812`
`#define PIXEL_BRIGHTNESS 70`
 




## Hardware

The Neopixels run on 5v logic but the Photon is 3v logic. A solution for this problom woud be a Logic Level Converter  from 3v to 5v, but if you're like me then you want to start now with what you have on hand Breadboard, strip and photon. The strips do work on 3v it's really not recomended, but they do work. Just don't try to turn on 60 LEDs. It worked for me with 14 LEDs at 70%  brightness. 

This is very simple connection. Again this is NOT the recommended way of doing it but it works.

Now you can flash the photon.

## Generate SunRise Hex
The SunRise Hex program is not uses anymore we are using color temperature and converting it to rgb. It is way more precise and creates a more realistic light output.

But if you want to check out the program you can it's great for grabbing lots of hex values from an image.


## TODO 

 1. Ios app
 2. pcb
 3. lamp frame
 4. ...
